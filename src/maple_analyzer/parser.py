"""Turn per-field OCR text (from regions.py's FIELD_BOXES + ocr.py's
read_field()) into structured HP/MP/EXP/LV values.

Each field is OCR'd from its own tightly-cropped, isolated box now (see the
2026-08-17 recognition-only rework in ocr.py/capture.py) -- there's exactly
one string per field, always. Earlier versions of this module had to handle
RapidOCR sometimes merging a label+value into one detected box and sometimes
splitting them into two ('HP' + '[506/824]'), with a position-based
nearest-neighbor fallback for the split case; that's gone now, because
per-field cropping means there's no "other box" to merge or split against --
regex against the one string is always enough.

EXP is shown by the game as `cur[percentage%]` together, e.g. `162950[38.05%]`.
The '.' and/or closing ']' are the most OCR-fragile part of the string (observed
dropped in testing, e.g. '4980%' instead of '49.80%') -- normalized by treating
a bare >=3-digit run before '%' as implying 2 decimal places, since that's this
game's percentage precision.
