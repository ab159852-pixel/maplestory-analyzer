"""Occlusion detection: is another window covering the stat panel?

`mss` grabs a screen *region*, not the game's pixels, so anything resting on
that strip is what reaches OCR. Live capture (2026-08-17) caught the app
reading its own log back off a terminal covering the panel, which parsed as
MP 1/2 and booked the whole bar as loss.

The Win32 lookup is injected, so the logic here is testable off Windows like
the rest of the suite.
