"""Calibration: establishing max HP/MP and the starting EXP from scratch.

Session(require_calibration=True) is the default -- see rate.py's Session
docstring for the full design. In short: a single first reading is never
trusted (see the two bugs it fixes below), each of max HP, max MP, and
starting EXP is corroborated independently, and a tick where the whole
snapshot visibly moved counts for more than one where it didn't (the
liveness tiebreaker) -- but repetition alone is never sufficient, because
static OCR garbage from a covered panel repeats identically every tick too.
